If you're interested in blockchain development, chances are you've heard of Solidity. But what is it exactly, and why is it so important in the world of decentralized applications?

## üí° What is Solidity?

At its core, _Solidity_ is a programming language designed specifically for writing smart contracts on the **Ethereum** blockchain. It's similar to other high-level programming languages like Java or Python, but with some key differences that make it uniquely suited for building decentralized applications.

Simply put, Solidity is the language that allows developers to write code for smart contracts

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  A **Smart Contract** is a self-executing agreement between two or more
  parties, written in code and stored on the blockchain. Once the conditions of
  the contract are met, the contract executes automatically, without the need
  for intermediaries or third parties.
</Callout>

## üßê A closer look at Solidity

So what makes Solidity special? For one, it's designed to be turing complete, which means it can handle any computation that can be done by a computer. This makes it incredibly versatile, allowing developers to write complex, multi-step smart contracts that can perform a wide range of tasks.

Another key feature of Solidity is that it's specifically designed to work with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is the runtime environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By writing code in Solidity, developers can create smart contracts that can be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and interact with other contracts and applications.

## üåü Why learn Solidity?

So why is all of this important? Well, smart contracts have the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries, from finance and real estate to supply chain management and healthcare. By automating complex business processes and eliminating the need for intermediaries, smart contracts can save time, reduce costs, and increase transparency and security.

And the potential rewards can be huge. Just look at some of the real-world examples of successful smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. For instance, the decentralized finance (DeFi) space has exploded in recent years, with projects like _**Uniswap**_ and _**Aave**_ generating millions of dollars in revenue through their smart contracts.

But it's not just financial applications that can benefit from smart contracts. In 2018, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) launched a pilot project to use smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to [track tuna fishing](https://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?320232/New-Blockchain-Project-has-Potential-to-Revolutionise-Seafood-Industry) in the Pacific. By using smart contracts to verify that tuna was being caught sustainably and legally, the WWF was able to increase transparency and accountability in the fishing industry.

So whether you're interested in building the next big DeFi project or using smart contracts to make a positive impact on the world, Solidity is a powerful tool that can help you get there.
