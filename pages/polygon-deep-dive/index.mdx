## Introduction

Welcome to the world of üíú Polygon, the **Blockchain for mass adoption**! When you first visit the Polygon website, you'll notice the the title says: "Blockchain for mass adoption." Also you see a couple of organizations who have _Build on Polygon_ to make Blockchain accessible to all. It's a phrase that immediately captures your attention and makes you wonder, "What's so special about this blockchain?".

Well, let's start with the problem it solves. You see, there's this popular blockchain platform called Ethereum. It's great for building decentralized applications and executing smart contracts, but it has a couple of issues. First, its scalability problems make it difficult for many people to use it. And second, its gas fees are so high that you might have to take out a mortgage just to pay for a transaction.

Just take a look at the list of big-name companies that have already implemented Polygon, including Reddit and Lens Protocol. Reddit has onboard more than 6 million users into the web3 space via their NFTs, like the Superbowl Collection, CryptoSnoos collection and Reddit avatar NFTs. Lens Protocol, a decentralized social graph, is empowering many decentralized social media applications. These companies are just a few of the many that are leveraging the power of Polygon to create new and exciting use cases for blockchain technology.

But how did Polygon become the blockchain for mass adoption? Well, it's a story of perseverance, innovation, and a little bit of luck. In this article series, we'll take you on a journey through the realm of Polygon and show you how it's making the world a better place, one transaction at a time. So grab your oxygen tanks üê†, an extra pair of Diving Masks ü§ø, and let's explore how Polygon is ...

## The Blockchain Trilemma

Let's talk about the blockchain trilemma, a concept that has been a thorn in the side of blockchain technology since its inception. The term was coined by _Vitalik Buterin_, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, and it refers to the challenge of achieving optimal levels of three key elements in blockchain: decentralization, security, and scalability.

But here's the catch: it's almost impossible to achieve all three elements at the same time. As you increase one, it usually means that another will be weakened. It's like trying to juggle three balls at once - it's a tricky balancing act.

For example, let's take a look at Bitcoin. It's decentralized and secure, but it's not very scalable. This means that as the network grows and more transactions are made, the system becomes slower and more expensive to use. On the other hand, Ethereum is highly scalable, but it's not very decentralized. This means that it's easy to manipulate the network and steal funds.

## Scalability

**Scalability** - it's a term that's thrown around a lot in the blockchain space, but what does it actually mean? Well, in short, it refers to the ability of a blockchain to handle more and more transactions as its user base grows. And that's a big challenge, especially if blockchain technology is going to be used by billions of people around the world.

Many blockchains still struggle to achieve scalability, which is where Polygon comes in. Let's take a closer look at some of the ways that blockchain scalability is being addressed, and how Polygon is leading the way.

One approach is called **sharding**. This involves breaking up the blockchain into smaller parts, or shards, which can then be processed simultaneously. This can significantly increase the number of transactions that can be processed in a given amount of time. But it's not a perfect solution, and there are still some concerns about security and decentralization.

Another approach is to use different **consensus mechanisms**. As we mentioned earlier, Bitcoin uses proof of work, which is resource-intensive and can slow down the network. Other blockchains, such as Ethereum, use proof of stake, which is faster and more energy-efficient. But there are still some trade-offs, and it's not clear which consensus mechanism is the best.

But one of the most promising approaches is **layer 2 solutions**. This is where Polygon comes in. By building a layer 2 scaling solution on top of Ethereum, Polygon is able to provide fast and low-cost transactions while maintaining security and decentralization. This is achieved through a combination of proof of stake and plasma, which enables Polygon to offer a scalable and secure platform that can handle high volumes of transactions without sacrificing decentralization.

And the real-world applications of Polygon's scalability solutions are already becoming apparent. Companies like Reddit, Aavegotchi, and OpenSea have all integrated Polygon into their platforms to provide faster and cheaper transactions for their users. So, while blockchain scalability may still be a challenge for many blockchains out there, Polygon is leading the way in providing scalable, secure, and decentralized solutions that can help bring blockchain to the masses.
